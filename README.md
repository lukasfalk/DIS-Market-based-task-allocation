# Distributed Intelligent Systems ENG-466
Project 4 - Market-based task allocation with heterogeneous team of robots


Notes:
We have privileged knowledge of map (coordinates of wall), GNSS absolute robot location and tasks at all times. 
Time drain (2 minutes) is for moving to task, and completing task (waiting for x seconds depending on task and robot type).
The robots know the 1/3 + 2/3 for spawning a new task A or B.

Questions:
Do we use GNSS at the moment?
